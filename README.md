# World Weather Analysis

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to randomly generate a list of 2000 cities and determine weather conditions of these cities.  The end user is then asked for their temperature preference for a vacation spot and using API calls through Open Weather Map and Google Maps the user is provided with potential vacation locations and hotel options in line with their preferences.  Additionally, the end user can view a map and choose locations they would like to visit and get directions between these locations.
